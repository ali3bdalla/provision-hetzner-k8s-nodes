# provision-hetzner-k8s-nodes
The "provision-hetzner-k8s-nodes" GitHub repository is a public Terraform project designed to automate the provisioning of Kubernetes nodes on the Hetzner Cloud infrastructure. This repository provides infrastructure-as-code (IaC) scripts and configurations to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner Cloud servers
Repository Contents:

Terraform Configuration Files: This repository contains a set of Terraform configuration files that define the desired infrastructure resources. These files are written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and specify the details of Hetzner Cloud servers, networking, and other necessary resources.

Documentation: The repository includes a well-structured README file with comprehensive documentation. The README guides users through the process of using the Terraform scripts to provision Hetzner Cloud Kubernetes nodes. It provides step-by-step instructions, explanations of configuration variables, and best practices for setting up and managing the Kubernetes cluster.

Scripts and Modules: The repository may include additional scripts or Terraform modules that enhance the functionality of the provisioning process. These modules could address specific requirements, such as setting up load balancers, deploying monitoring tools, or integrating with external services.

Examples: To help users get started quickly, the repository might include example configurations and usage scenarios. These examples showcase different deployment options, such as varying node sizes, using different Kubernetes configurations, and integrating with different add-ons.

License: The repository includes the appropriate open-source license file (e.g., MIT, Apache) that governs how others can use, modify, and distribute the code.

How to Use:

Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning the GitHub repository to your local machine using the git clone command.

Configure Variables: Open the Terraform configuration files and set the required variables such as API keys, cluster size, node types, and network settings. These variables will determine the specifics of your Kubernetes cluster.

Initialize Terraform: Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform environment. This command downloads the necessary providers and modules.

Preview Changes: Run terraform plan to preview the changes that Terraform will make to your infrastructure based on the configured variables.

Apply Changes: If the preview looks good, execute terraform apply to provision the Hetzner Cloud Kubernetes nodes according to the configuration.

Access Kubernetes Cluster: Once the provisioning process is complete, the README documentation will guide you on how to access and manage your newly created Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner Cloud.

Cleanup: If needed, you can use terraform destroy to tear down the infrastructure and remove all resources created by Terraform.

By providing this repository, users can easily set up and manage Kubernetes clusters on the Hetzner Cloud infrastructure without manually going through the complex provisioning process. The infrastructure-as-code approach ensures consistency, repeatability, and version control for the entire Kubernetes environment.
